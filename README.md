# Murder Code (C version)

## How to use

### Base system

MCode is code editor meant for my programming language N++, and my coming soon compiler V++.
There is a code editor displaying colored text of what file you are looking at.
There is also a file explorer to look at files. When you click on a file it appears in the editor. If you click on a directory it opens the directory to see the files inside with a "Return to home dir" button on top to go back to the directory you started in.
I also have a PowerShell part so you can run PowerShell commands. Unfortunately there is feature allowing you to see the text you type, you just have to hope you typed it right.
At the top is a hotbar with a file and mode button. Clicking file allows you to save the file you are currently, open a new home directory, save your file as a new file, and make a new file. Clicking mode gives 4 options for dark, dark contrast, light, or light contrast mode.
You can also select text by dragging the mouse across the text, and click on a place on text to get there.
